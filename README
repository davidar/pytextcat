PyTextCat[1] guesses the language of a given input text from over 70 different
languages.

It is an implementation of the classification technique described by William B.
Cavnar & John M. Trenkle (1994) in N-Gram-Based Text Categorization[2], and is
based upon Gertjan van Noord's Perl implementation[3].

textcat.py provides a command-line interface to the library. Run it with no
arguments to see usage information.

PyTextCat is released under GPLv2 (see COPYING). The lm files and test texts
are from TextCat[3], and are therefore licensed under LGPLv2.1
(see COPYING.LGPL).
